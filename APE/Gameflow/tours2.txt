Boy, there's advice and then there's common sense, both of which I've no qualms about slapping you across the mouth with, so open those elephant ears and listen up. OneGate may seem a paragon of good-natured sunshine, but that place is as corrupt as a three day-old geese turd that's been sitting in your sister's left cheek for two months." 
ws_yammer2$="They sell you the three thousand year-old song & dance and expect you to clap for nothing. Just because you've got businessmen who've been doin' the business of business since the Cordican pharaohs were trading discount tablets for Brebulan grain-rice doesn't mean you gotta cheapen the experience of capitalism for the rest of us." 
ws_yammer3$="You gotta be business-wise. You gotta have gut smarts. One look at you and I know you're no mover-shaker, son. I've met hundreds of 'em. They look nothing like you. Appearances notwithstanding, the biggest giveaway to you fly-weight nature is that you're standing in The Bricks. Nobody who was ever anybody would ever dip their toes here." 
ws_yammer4$="This ain't a place to live, breath or make money. Venture capital? Buddy, try murder-death capital. And the boozers at OneGate are the worst of the lot. They'll sell you your wishes, one by one, at the foot of your dreams, until all of your hard-earned cash is in their pockets. They are the new pharaohs and they're hiding out on Anachronox. OneGate is their newest den of iniquity." 
ws_yammer5$="I don't remember if you're old enough to remember the Cordican Dynasty Wars back in aught-nine... some of the gents in charge of the pyramid malls fled Cordica before they could be brought to trial. And just where do you think they went? That's right, scumbo. They came to the one place anyone can hide without fear of being found... Anachronox." 
ws_yammer6$="You think OneGate was always the bright, shining, money beacon that it is now? Once it was just as dingy, gray, and soul shattering as The Bricks. I'm sure I don't have to tell you that if you got enough money, you can turn a trot tray into a ham palace. And that's just what they did... built on the blood of the haggler mummies collecting dust in their bargainer tombs."
