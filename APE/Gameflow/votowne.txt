I just want a moment to tell a little story from my yesteryears. And I ain't spinning no tale, or weaving no yarn here. It's pure truth." 
ws_yammer2$="Long years ago, there was a time I owned a Bipidri. I'd left the military for a soul-searching quest to find myself. I spent an Indian summer building a cabin in the Cordican backwoods. It was complete with a chicken coop and a domestic bippy for companionship. It sang while I worked. I remember that Fall fondly." 
ws_yammer3$="In my youthful optimism, I named him \"Alejandro\" after the Hispanist singer. And even though he was dumb as a plumb bob, I had to love him: the poor thing was a castrato. You see... Bipidri breeders cut off their tiny whizzermabobs before they reach pubertus so that they retain their soprano voices. How could I not feel for him?" 
ws_yammer4$="Well, two weeks into winter and everything turned south on a dime. A hannigan fox broke into the chicken coop and enjoyed a five-course fete. The same week, a water pipe sprang a leak over my winter rations. I was getting hungry and Alejandro was getting nervous. He stopped singing altogether in order to be less conspicuous. But it didn't help." 
ws_yammer5$="I hadn't eaten in two days, and there was a Gorian opera acting up in my stomach. My options were quickly disappearing. It was with a heavy heart that I approached his cage. Alejandro looked up at me with those huge, weepy eyes... then he saw the gutting knife in my hand. I still remember the look on his face." 
ws_yammer6$="Bipidri meat ain't tender, my friend. I was a strong arm in my youth, and Alejandro made for an uphill cut-job. His limbs were especially fibrous. You get your knife caught in a blood hose, and you're looking at some soaked meat. Took me half an hour just to cut around his vein cavity and such." 
ws_yammer7$="Point is, you're talking to the wrong man if you're looking for sympathy when it comes to eating the farm. Making laws ain't gonna stop a starving man from killing a walking ball of meat, son. Frankly, if they're slaughtered the same way cattle are, I don't see the problem.
